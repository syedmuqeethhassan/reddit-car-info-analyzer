      "selftext": "I'm just a rando consumer who really doesn't care about which brand v brand. I just want the best car for my vehicle for my price point. The price point for me is $60K.. perhaps bit more.\n\nI went to test drive the Lexus RX ($57K for the 350 Premium trim)\n\n* It was just slow and felt sluggish and slow. I'm sure many would say RX you gotta do the higher powertrain/hybrid.\n* An older simpler AWD system.\n* An older aging 8-speed tranmission too.\n* The cabin wasn't all that quiet either. 54-55dB which is same as Pilot/Palisade/Telluride (wihtin +1/1.5 dB)\n* We were not impressed by the fake leather interior. It looked and felt cheap. Man it felt so plasticky and fake inside. I'm sorry, I have to be honest because luxury cars are all about the interior right? The salesperson told me, you had to go for the Luxury package which was very very nice indeed in the showroom. But unfortunately the Lux pkg were rare at the 350 trim unless you go 450 hybrid. And those were way out of my price range.\n* My research indicates that nationally RXs are selling at eithier right at MSRP or above MSRP today.\n\nWe went to test drive the Acura RDX immediately.\n\n* Immediately it was far more responsive. I looked up 0 to 60mph for both vehicles; RDX was indeed 1 sec faster.\n* Super-Handling AWD is mechanically superior with the torque vectoring. Each wheel can have a different acceleration. When you turn corners, the outer wheels front & rear will accelerate faster vs inside wheels for hugging the road. This also works great in snow & rain.\n* 10-speed tranmission.\n* Adaptive dampening suspension system. This is also mechanically superior.\n* A quieter cabin, felt more isolated.\n* The base trim has leather then you can also upgrade to the italian premium leather.\n* Guess what... the entire HIGHEST trim tops out at $54.5K? I was surprised a bit.\n* And also, it seems like it can get a good $4-5K below MSRP. This makes the gap pretty wide.\n\nPlease tell me what am I paying Lexus for? It's slower, handles worse, worse or similar interior. What's left? Reliability is similar too. Acura and Lexus are both Japanese.\n\nI realized I'm really paying premium JUST for the Lexus name and Acura is really going for the value approach. I did not know that. My two Acura dealerships each have 22 & 27 top-trim Acura RDXs in their lots. The Lexus RXs are all sold out, lol.",

A 20-year-old car is going to have 20-year-old car problems, namely rubber and plastic bits in and on it needing to be replaced.

Previous daily was a 97 Lesabre until I crashed it. Both cars I’m looking at are in the 5-6k range, the ls430 is not optioned out but even a base model is really nice. The Jetta is a 03 wagon with a tdi and manual, the ls430 would probably be more fun on the weekend and very very comfortable while driving but the Jetta gets incredible fuel mileage, is a wagon and a manual. I also have a 05 3500 Chevy so this car really just needs to get me to and from for a decent price, be decent to drive in town and not be a land yacht, but still be somewhat fun when I just drive for fun. Thanks for any help",

Only thing we need to check is if the timing belt’s been done within 100,000 miles then the only maintenance you really have is oil every 10k and a fuel filter every 25k.\nPlus, if you decide to modify it further down the road, there’s a decent aftermarket of parts tunes, etc. to go down the rabbit hole of (which I have somewhat)\nThe only really downside to the Jetta is the interior may be a little rough cause it’s old plastic starting to get weak and have us weird coating that starts to smell like a crayon factory and can get brittle",
