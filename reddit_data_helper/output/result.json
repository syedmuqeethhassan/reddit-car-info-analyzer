      "selftext": "I found this Infiniti G35 coupe with 150k miles for only $4500 I was thinking about either getting this a 97 mustang gt or a 94 camaro. I was wondering what you guys think. This G35 has the perfect blend of performance, reliability, and fun. The milage is a little high but I heard of these things going over 300k with basic maintenance.",

It's basically a fancy 350Z so it drives pretty nice and still has nice creature comforts. They are available in RWD and AWD so if you live in a snowy area, get the AWD version.\n\nOnly things to consider are that insurance might be pretty high since this is typically used as a takeover car, and gas mileage isn't too great since it's a V6 in a relatively heavy coupe. Other than that, great car and I'd recommend it for sure.",

No aux input. No backup camera. No ipod connectivity. (Yes, theres such things as aftermarket radios but why would you want to spend extra money when you could just buy a more reliable car with that shit installed basic)\nThe power steering hose busted after 20k miles. A 800 dollar fix. The fuel sending unit broke after 15k miles. A 1500 dollar fix that I ain't fixing. The front leather seats cracked horribly after 1.5 years (probably should've got seat covers but still) and last but not least all the lights in the cabin have stopped working so at night I have to use a flashlight.\n\nBIGGEST REASON: It only gets 20-24 mpg. Yes, the V6 engine is fast and powerful, and RWD is.. cool I guess, but after a few months of dropping $50+ at the pump to fill that 20 gallon tank the novelty quickly wears off and you're left wishing you'd bought a nice used prius with the same mileage or literally any car with better fuel economy.\n\nMy advice: Shop around more and consider the long term fuel and upkeep cost of your vehicle, especially because it's your first car. \n\nOne more thing: G35 is a luxury car and that means parts are expensive. Unreliable car + expensive parts = a sad owner. \nDont do it.",

      "selftext": "In a bit of a pickle with deciding whether I should get the 07 infiniti G35 or Honda Accord EX V6? They both are the same exact price. Here's a breakdown of what they have. \n\n**07 Infiniti G35:**  \n\\- 214k miles\n\n\\- 2 Owners (2nd owner sold it within a year)  \n\\- Navi System and generally better tech   \n\\- Clean Title\n\n**03 Honda Accord EX:**  \n\\- 184k miles  \n\\- 1 Owner  \n\\- Clean Title\n\nInsurance on both is around the same too (Im a young adult so I get charged heavy on insurance)\n\nSide Note:  \nThere is also a Lexus ES 300 and Chrysler Base 300 for sale too cheaper than the 07 g35 and 03 Accord, both under 200k miles, but they both need touch ups. Still drivable but I can't really afford to fix up a car.\n\nIf Anyone needs more info on either car just comment and I'll lyk!",
