      "selftext": "I live in a rural area where the vast majority of people drive full sized pickups. I have several friends that have purchased 2023 and 2024 F-150s that have done nothing but break down weeks after getting them. My BIL bought a 2024 and it has left him stranded 6 times in the 4 months he's owned it. These trucks used to be bullet proof, what happened? Both my parents have older fords that were very reliable. Now it seems Ford has completely fallen off. ",

One of the \"cheaper\" ones, and even still, an engine swap or partial rebuild will cost $3-7k for anything of about the same age.\n\nA new engine/head gasket isn't costing $2k and under unless it's an older car where parts are much more common/cheap. And even then, those are often friend prices or if the tech is doing it for himself (meaning no labor costs). For example, I replaced the engine on my brother's 2007 Honda Civic for him over the weekend (it's an 07, so it was in the affected range of the block cracking issue, which is what happened). I got the engine delivered from a yard for $750 and I spent ~$120 replacing miscellaneous things while the engine was out (rather my brother gave me the money for parts and I ordered them as needed), but I don't charge my close relatives labor. They've done a lot to help me, so charging in this case isn't appropriate IMO. But if this was a customer job, I wouldn't touch it for less than $2500. And that would be as a side job for me personally. Through the dealer, it's more like $4k. With something like a 2018 Pilot, the parts alone will cost $2-3k if I ordered them myself. If the dealer orders them, they have to make money for their time, so it's getting marked up (not sure what Ford Ecoboosts cost to swap relative to a J series).\n\nDealers are expensive. It's just the nature of the beast. If cost is your concern, you came to the wrong place. But for some people, the peace of mind from the use of OEM parts and manufacturer trained technicians is worth the extra cost. We often get cars that were botched or misdiagnosed by other shops for this reason (not to say all DIYers or independent shops are bad or that all dealers are good, just that when people realize with labor, you usually get what you pay for, especially on big jobs)",

That means you'll be able to afford to finance the new engine and make monthly payments on it, so take out a $14k personal loan or whatever other way you can get the best rate to borrow the money, and then basically treat it like you're buying a new F150 Raptor for $14k, because in a way, you are. And then once that's paid off, you'll be in a great spot - you'll own the truck outright (again) and it'll have a nearly new engine in it.\n\nI think that's probably your best choice. It's going to be way, way more expensive to sell it as is and buy a new truck. Like, many tens of thousands of dollars more expensive. Your most financially smart decision you can make at this point is to pay the money and get this truck fixed.",

Get a used 6-10 year old Tacoma or Tundra (no more than $40k, ideally less). Buying a $90k luxury trim truck just to tow a boat is like buying a brand new Mercedes because you want to deliver pizzas.

Take the L, learn from it, make moves so that don’t end up with you back in this situation or in a worse one (starting with not having that much money tied up in a truck), and you’ll be much better off and happier for it.",

That’s how I define “afford”, not just if you have money to pay a bill on a car. Unless you own a 69 Corvette or a 67 Mustang, all cars go down in value, all vehicle repairs result in a net loss. That’s the just the nature of owning a car. If it were me, I’d pay the fix, pay the car off, sell it, get a cheaper basic truck, put the rest back in my savings, and enjoy life again.",

And as long as I worked as a dealer tech, we never got Jasper or LKQ engines unless the customer supplied it. A lot of the time, long blocks on not-brand-new vehicles like OP’s will be remanned. $14k with labor is actually a crazy good price considering you have to transfer a whole bunch of shit from the old engine to the new long block. I’m not sure why every Redditor who’s never worked on a car before thinks all engine replacements should be $500.",

And even then, only if it's a low demand engine on an older car. \n\nFor example, I did the engine on my brother's 2007 Honda Civic this past Saturday. I ordered the engine from a yard, but I didn't have the time to pull it myself, so I paid extra for them to deliver it to the shop I work at. It ended up being $750 with a warranty (which I'm glad I got because the 1st engine I got ended up having a bad head gasket). And with junkyard engines, you don't know what condition the car was in before it was scrapped, so the extra cost will often be well worth it  as it was in my case. And keep in mind, the engine I replaced was a Honda R18. Those are an older engine model now and aside from the block cracking on older ones like what happened to this car, they really don't fail if properly maintained. If it were something like the Hyundai/Kia Theta II where they fail left and right, the yards would be having hundreds of shops fighting over a handful of engines, so prices will naturally rise.\n\nThis is also why some cars simply aren't worth buying, even if they can be purchased for cheap. They're prone to very expensive failures, made even more expensive due to parts shortages.",

It is not like owning a 2nd generation Tacoma or Camry where you can put off maintenance and get away with it. \n\nFrom my own experience they are affordable and good vehicles if you do the maintenance ",

In 2020, Stuart Rowley was tapped to improve quality, but almost no improvement to relevant metrics were accomplished. He left in 2022, replaced by Jim Baumbick. Baumbick's run at improving quality was equally futile, and the company was forced to issue recall after recall and was penalized by the government for failing to issue recalls on top of that.\n\nBaumbick was gone at the end of 2024, and we're waiting to see who is willing to put his head on the chopping block next for Ford.\n\nTheir reputation is well deserved. Jim Farley probably needs to be replaced for further soiling the company's reputation during his 5 years as CEO.",

My ford had many rust problems/random small issues. My Chevy was a pos, interior creaked had significantly less miles with way more engine issues but no rust, no little bs issues. It just depends on what you like and how you’re educated. Personally I think ford is a better company but in the long run I usally just buy what looks best.",

Although domestic brands don’t do as well in terms of reliability and resale value as the quality leaders, each of the big three domestic brands will have models where some are better and some worse than average.

I was in Vermont at the time and needed that type of vehicle. Loved my 2016 forester xt. I ordered it special and waited the months for it to arrive. It served me well, but my warranty ended at 100k, and despite having some smaller transmission issues, Subaru refused to cover my cvt dying at 100,500 in 2022. I believe the VT branch fucked it up, and when I moved, they wouldn’t cover it. Eventually, with a lot of complaining and without my vehicle for 2 months, they gave me the option to get an ok trade in considering the cvt issue, and a little off a new Subaru. I then got a 2022 Wilderness and while it seemed like a great vehicle, it had numerous issues and I ended up striking a deal to get rid of it at 30k miles. So, I don’t know. The state of vehicles is pretty sad right now.",

Took it to the dealer to get a free replacement and they said that’s what I get for not changing the coolant according to schedule. The vehicle had less than 5000 miles on it. The solution Ford came up with was to redesign the thermostats with more clearance. ",

          "text": "Ford trucks and larger SUVs (Explorer, Expedition) seem to be mostly decent. I'd even go as far as to say mid-2000s smaller vehicles are pretty good too. I had a 2006 Focus with 239k on the clock when her life was tragically cut short by a distracted driver in a Jeep. Still ran great and never gave me any issues before then. I took that car everywhere. I still see 05-07 Focuses (Focii?) everywhere, beat to absolute hell and still putting in the miles.\n\nThings started to go to shit around 2012 or so with the PowerShift (AKA PowerShit) transmissions in the Fiesta and Focus. What a dumpster fire. Fusion and Escape of this era were still good though. And then here comes 2013 with redesigned Fusions and Escapes with small EcoBoost engines and transmissions co-designed with GM that, while not PowerShit bad, were also kinda problematic. I believe major problems with these engines started coming up more or less immediately, with the 1.6L in 2013-early 14 Fusions catching fire, and almost all iterations developing coolant intrusion into the cylinders due to a design flaw in the block. Issues were supposedly brought up before these engines even went into production, but they were made anyway. Owners of certain years were given extended warranties but no recall or anything was ever issued. These engines are currently the subject of a class action lawsuit due to Ford's refusal to do anything for owners out of warranty when they knew these engines were problematic. I had a 2014 Fusion for four years, during that time I would get a new recall about every year or so, and once it hit 100k she became a shop queen, though my transmission never failed and my engine never developed coolant intrusion as many, many do.\n\nI will never own another Ford. Partly because of their quality issues, but more because of their terrible response to known issues.",

First let’s  start with the Escape because it is a throw away vehicle.   Transmission problems, electrical and stupid software.   Shame on you Ford.  F150 has been great other than the headers rusting out.  Seriously Dumb.   Vans all have transmission issues.  F250 is solid overall.   Maverick Hybrids so far so good.  ALL have terrible Apple connectivity and Ford doesn’t GAF.   My biggest issue is that Ford makes some really dumb engineering decisions.   Like plastic freeze plugs to save 5 cents.   They have always had a reputation of cost cutting into serious quality issues and there is no adult supervision before these changes take place.   Calling the EV a mustang with zero roots in the mustang.  Many of their lower end vehicles are designed to last 100k and then just die and even quite a few mid range ones.   They have cheapened the F150 to a point it’s a shame and none of the changes are to make it better, just cheaper. \n\nWith all that said, GM is just as bad and Dodge I would call criminal over the last 25 years how little they care about their customers.  Face is American Manufacturers don’t want your vehicle lasting 200k or more.  They want you to buy a new one.",

          "text": "Many years of poor quality control and lack of long-term planning has led them to this point.\n\nIn 2017, they announced they were killing the sedan market in North America. And after 2025, the Focus will be discontinued and that will be the end of Ford Europe selling sedans as well. Their strategy was to focus on selling SUVs that command higher price tags & higher profit margins, but they cited, \"consumer demand,\" despite the fact automakers spent years pushing SUVs out to consumers to also dodge stricter environmental & safety regulations. Their solution? Reintroduce the Bronco as an extremely expensive Jeep Wrangler competitor, rework & replace the Ford Escape as a \"Bronco Sport,\" and continue pushing pickup trucks.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford is on-record for recalling more vehicles in 2024 than any other automaker. Everything from electronic issues to mechanical failures & engine fires have all been warranted concerns for them to issue these recalls. Basically, if you bought a Ford in the past 15 years, it likely has an open recall on it. And that's why Ford has become a brand to avoid.\n\nIts great your F150 is lasting. Is yours with a Coyote? Because those are the only good F150s left. The 3.5L Ecoboosts have the chain-driven water pumps which are a horrible point of failure and the 2.7L on later F150s have the infamous wet oil belt that the 1.0L Ecoboost has.\n\nEdit: to add to this, it's good that yours has the 6-speed which is regarded as one of Ford's better automatics. The 10R80 between its introduction in 2017 and August of 2023 had a problem with the reaction shell where the teeth would eventually shear. Ford's fix was to make a harder-tempered shell. Even though this was co-developed with GM, they never had this issue because they spent another 2 years developing the 10L80 to make sure an issue *like that* never happened.",

          "text": "The electric issues of the 80's to 90's mostly and when you seek help from Ford they say they don't know how to fix it 😑.  I've owned/driven 4 Ford's\n\n\nLate 80's bronco ii: great little SUV, ran for close to 200k miles before it started having random electric issues.  After about 6 months of battling one thing after another it stopped running and us, Ford and random shops couldn't diagnose it.  Best solution was to start replacing one piece at a time starting with the harness and this was pre cash for clunkers so it just didn't make any sense financially to save it .. though it was the cleanest bronco ii I've ever seen.  \n\n2014 fusion SE fleet model: basically the platinum with its stronger engine without the entertainment suite.  Great sedan, loved it.  The design was very sexy and aggressive for its time.  Quick and made you feel fast, loved the sport mode.  First care I've ever owned that could spin the tires during a roll.  Had a surprising amount of trunk space too.  Issues I had with the fusion is that it went through struts like candy and that meant it went through tires too... It has a weird tire/rim combo that only nicer BMW's were using at the time so it was $$$ to replace.  \n\n2018 f150 xlt STX edition: sexiest truck on the road at that time.  The 2.7/10 speed is pretty legendary and feels amazing.  5.0 power from a Ford V6.  Great package interior wise and even had to assist built in.  Only con was that the engine lacked the noise that you want from your truck.  Sold it when me and the ex-wife were family planning/buying a house.  \n\n2019 f150 xl STX:  less bells and whistles than the xlt but does everything just as well.  Same as the other truck, zero problems other than the 10 speed doesn't like shifting when it's -15 out.  Probably will get it flushed as it's sitting at 53k miles now.  People talk a lot of crap on these trucks but they don't rust, have great power and now that there's been some time we're seeing people pushing north of 500k miles on original drivetrains.  \n\n\nSo from my experience Ford has been absolutely fantastic.  Some vehicles have their quirks but they've gotten things right especially in the last decade.  It always amazes me as far as truck reputation goes that Toyota can coast on a reputation they gained 40-50 years ago that no longer applies while the current f-150's are brilliant but they can't escape the reputation from 35-45 years ago.  \n\nI've owned/driven Subarus, hondas, Toyota's, Chevy's and chryslers.  I've driven just about everything under the sun outside of exotics as I used to work in rentals but these are what I've had time in and worked on.",

And replacing the pump is a $2k job.\n3. 2.0 EcoBoost block deck design; to allow coolant to go from one side of the cylinder to the other, they cut a slot in the deck. Cheap ass fix, it effectively cuts in half the head gaskets sealing ability. Slowly leaks coolant into the cylinder. Hasn't been recalled. \n4. Lug nuts with cheap tin covers.

But given that they’d always lasted well for me I tried to find another Ford vehicle in 2021…. And I didn’t like what they offered anymore. They seem to only focus on the customer who wants a high end truck or suv. No more cars. Their “entry” level truck at the time was a $36K Ranger. The only car was a Mustang, and the base model has a turbo 4 (granted it makes 300hp and probably performs fine, but I have a family of 4, can’t make due in a Mustang for long). \n\nThe EcoSport was garbage, we’d just sold off a 2014 Escape and my wife didn’t want another one. All the recalls were making me a little nervous and I had a relative who was getting constant issues with one of the new EcoBoost engines. \n\nSo I bought Japanese. I have a Honda Odyssey and a Mazda CX-5 now. Had Ford still offered a Focus or Fusion I would still have at least one Ford car to pair with our minivan. \n\nBut for me, Ford’s quality wasn’t what made me shop elsewhere, it’s just that everything important to me as a buyer, Ford is no longer offering.  \n\nHonestly, who has $50K for an SUV or $65K for a truck?

          "text": "I was a die hard ford truck guy. I jade owned several new Ford F-150’s It was the quality control issues.\nThen shady shit dealers got away with so they were never correctly fixed and the one was never solved. Documented as such not encode it went out of warranty  I  was told I’d have to pay out of pocket if I wanted them to continue to trouble shoot it, how many firing times am I supposed to leave it with you and you not do chit. Now you want me to pay berceuse you don’t fix it ins timely manner? They had it for a whole two weeks at one point!!!! Wtf!!!! \n\nFord didn’t do chit to fix it back then and still doesn’t. They let the dealers run wild with their bs. \n\nI almost almost  came back to the fold for the Bronco… We won’t even get into that whole mess. First vehicle I ever put an order in for and it was such a negative experience.   It ruined it for me. \n   I had 79 bronco when I was kid. Next to my fox body mustang I had it was  all my time fav vehicle I owned.\n \n\nI personally won’t buy a Ford again. \n\nBottom line they can all suck at some point….Some can also produce one hell of a vehicle and then absolutely botch it  putting their head up their behind making stupid changes or trying to save a buck. \n\nThey are all slow to act… Talking  to people  who worked at a multiple ford plants and them  taking about how bad morale was because of corporate bs and attitude . Or employees  knew what it would take to fix whatever. But the  big bosses just belittled them and you aren’t be seen not heard bs.  I have a manufacturing background so sometimes it’s hard to not want to scream because I get it.\n\n\n I can tell ya about all the shady shit Toyota has done too. Fixing stuff myself on a Tacoma because They refused and of course after I pay out of pocket to fix it myself they finally recall it (but they knew for years there was issues) or the frame rust/rot … The idiots at corporate couldn’t understand I owned homes in different states so the time of year/location  that was hard on the vehicle I was in the state under recall. (I did it backwards from most people). Winters in Midwest and summers in Southwest. Do them right thing no. They were willing to wait till someone t hurt. That whole gas pedal issue. I experienced it 4-6 weeks isn before  anyone was killed. I almost ate a semi hauling azz. I was standing on t damn break with both feet…  The second time I was then  positive it was the floor mat. Tossed it in bed to save it for proof. I called Toyota and requested to be contacted. Yeah nene be heard from them and they didn’t do chit… Years later when I brought it in for recalls the mechanic was asking where the floor mat was so they could I guess cut it or whatever. Dude I tossed it a long azz time ago. \n\nPick your poison and hope for the best .   If you get really lucky and find a kick ass dealership  they can be the game changer to win you over and keep you as client.  Hold on to them because they are a rare breed and worth their weight in gold.  I haven’t found one worth showing that loyalty to form any brand.  \n\nGot a local mechanic shop that’s worth their weight in gold. Daughter took her car into a stealership for(infinity) their oil change is a great price.  I  guess the crooks decided because she was a kid they tired to screw her and gave her a list of repairs  that were a must for ($3,000.00) said front bearing bad etc.  She was like can’t authorize anything, just a kid. , she’s talk to her parents.  My wife ran it over to our local shop asking if it’s safe to drive.  The manger calls a few hours later  and is like come get your car. There is nothing wrong with anything!!!! He’s like I made the mechanic physically verify because we know your daughter drives a lot. But it passed a drive test and now mechanic is like they are full of chit as he’s looking at it. We are 100 percent certain the bearing is fine. \n\nAgain this is why dealerships get a bad reputation and the manufacturer doesn’t hold them accountable when they get caught pulling that crap.  \n\nI kept getting warranty work on the  last ford I had for breaks. They told me they were replacing the discs each time. No they just kept cutting em down over over to the point I had no damn front breaks because of that crap (pads were all chewed up and they’d just sand down the rough edges but not replace)!!!! The discs were bad so doing that didn’t fix the issue. It just temporally hid the issue.  Until the day I had now… \n\nI finally had to have a tow truck take it somewhere. I didn’t trust the dealership at this point. So buddy suggested his shop around thr corner from work. They called like an hour later and were like it’s on the rack. You need to see this mess before we touch it!!!!  You won’t believe it…, Dealer still tired to lie and claim the discs  and pads were changed. No they weren’t. So I had to eat that out of pocket since I needed them fixed correctly and wanted to have working brakes. Ford didn’t do chit when I contacted corporate…",

It also was down in horsepower but they addressed that.\n\nI ordered a 2012 Fusion Hybrid that developed a check engine light and had a valve problem at approximately 2000 miles.\n\nI bought a 2018 Expedition that had the  cam-phaser issue that affected all 3.5 Ecoboost engines from that (and later) years. That engine happens to be shared with the F150, which is the best-selling vehicle in the US. I figured they would have gotten the gremlins exorcised since it had been out for a while in the F150. Nope.\n\nFord does not invest enough in validation. Every manufacturer can and will have problem areas, but you have to ask what's  different between Ford, who has the highest warranty costs in the car industry (as a percentage of sales, 2023) at 4 percent and Toyota, who has among the lowest at .8 percent (source www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20241003.html).\n\nThey both build vehicles in the US, so it's not (necessarily) the workers. Toyota happens to spend a lot more time validating and testing. There are other philosophical differences too (one difference being one of these manufacturers is much more concerned about quarterly earnings reports than the other).\n\nI am not saying Toyota is perfect. They have had frame rusting problems in the Tundra and oil sludge problems with their older 3.0 V6 mills. I am saying that the difference is  more philosophical than technical. As a son of a Ford factory worker, a Mechanical Engineering Major, and fan of the brand I have wished for decades that at the management level there would be enough pride in the brand to be among the best. It just seems obvious to me that it's better in the long term to have a good reputation than a poor one, for intangible as well as tangible reasons.\n\nFor one it means that you have to market less to sell your cars. You don't need to spend as much in incentives and advertising if your vehicles are known on the street for being good vehicles. But at a bottom-line level, which costs you more? To discover problems and issues when you only have test-mules on the road that you've tested for a half million miles and therefore know what will break and when, or to have shipped millions of vehicles that you have to recall later because your customers find problems that you could have caught during validation?",

Regardless of which one is used, it generally will eventually ruin the engine and result in a full engine replacement.\n\nPersonally, the only modern Ford engines I would trust are the 2.0T, 2.3T, 2.5L, and a couple of the larger V6s (I don't remember which ones off the top of my head) because those are the only current Ford engines that do not use any kind of wet belt in all application.",

          "text": "My personal 1994 Mustang GT Convertible - Shit underbuilt manual transmissions(Tremec T5). Shit rear suspension design, even for a live axle setup. 5.0 Windsor was kinda crap compared to the Chevy's at the time.\n\nMy personal 1998 Taurus wagon that I currently own - I got it for very cheap, but it's built like complete garbage and the transmission is a known POS that will self destruct and therefore has no towing capacity at all. The transmission also sucks at cooling itself which aids in the self destruction. All of the suspension creaks despite half of it being new. The front balljoint/control arm design is an absolute nightmare and the balljoints themselves are too small for the weight of the engine/transmission. The rear springs sag without any load. The cooling system isn't properly grounded from factory which causes the waterpump to eat itself, and then for some reason the heaters never seem to work in them. Every winter I freeze my balls off with the heater cranked all the way up, even with a new water pump and a coolant flush with no obstructions in the heater core. The evap systems are garbage and expensive to fix.\n\nMy wife's 1992 Ford Explorer - Nice car to drive but absolutely shit the bed under 150k. Fuel in the oil(Only fluid that didn't drop in levels precipitously). Transmission ate itself alive. It leaked every fluid you could imagine. Stalled randomly in huge intersections for my wife multiple times. Was it maintained well? Not particularly, but it didn't handle abuse \\*at all\\*.\n\nMy best friend's 2014 Escape - Known shit automatic transmission failed and cost nearly the worth of the car. Door handles broke making doors inoperable. \n\n6.0 and 6.4 diesels are notorious for being some of the worst American diesels ever made found in pickups.\n\nEven my dad's 1998 F350 Powerstroke had a random crack in the block around 250k and needed transmission rebuilds around every 120k miles. It also burned up the under valve cover electrical harness that includes the glow plug wiring etc multiple times.",

Everything is relative if you’re comparing interior quality to Toyota then of course Toyota’s better but when I compare an American, I’ll go ahead and compare it to another American like Dodge ex, Dodge ram 5.7 hemis which were junk with poor oiling to the head causing wear to the valve train components and lifter tick, whereas the comparable 5.0 dominated the 5.7 including interior and suspension quality and don’t get me started on the dodges transmissions, but when it comes to diesels I will always go with Cummins over powerstroke but I’d only get a manual Cummins.

          "text": "Manufacturing Defect in 2017 Ford Transit Connect 1.5 TDCi\nFord South Africa Case Number: 600100021\n\nI want to warn others about a serious manufacturing defect in the 2017 Ford Transit Connect 1.5 TDCi. The cambelt repeatedly fails well before its expected lifespan of 150,000 km - 200,000km, leading to catastrophic engine damage and costly repairs. \n\nI bought this vehicle second-hand, knowing that the previous owner had already experienced a cambelt failure at around 100,000 km, which resulted in a complete engine replacement by Ford. Believing the issue was resolved, I continued driving the car. However, after just 70,000 km on the new engine, the same problem occurred—the cambelt failed again, destroying the engine. This happened despite maintaining a full service history and minimal load on the vehicle.\n\nFord refuses to cover the cost of repairs, arguing that I am not a “loyal” customer because I did not service the car at their dealerships every time. However, the cambelt failure is unrelated to routine oil changes and clearly points to a manufacturing defect. Had I been informed that the cambelt could fail after just 70,000 km, I would have proactively replaced it every 50,000 km to avoid the cost and inconvenience of replacing the engine repeatedly.\n\nThe repair cost is R113,619, almost as much as the purchase price of the car (R180,000). If I proceed with the repairs, this would be the third engine in under 8 years—an unacceptable outcome for any vehicle.\n\nI am sharing this experience to warn others: Be cautious when buying a Ford. Despite clear evidence of a manufacturing defect, Ford refuses to take responsibility or offer goodwill assistance. I will never purchase a Ford vehicle again. I do not have the money to afford the repairs and will most likely have to scrap the car. R180 000 down the drain. If there is anyone that can help me. Please send me a direct message, I'm not receiving any help from Ford. My vehicle is still sitting at Ford Human Motors Bloemfontein, South Africa.\n\n#ford #fordperformance #Fordeverest #fordranger #FordRangerWildtrak #FordRangerRaptor #fordsouthafrica #FordAccessories #fordmustang #fordfocus #fordtransit #fordtransitcustom #fordgt40 #fordtransitvan #fordtransitconnect #fordtransitcamper #fordtransitconversion #fordgermany #fordusa #fordspain #fordworld #fordgt #FordTransit350 #fordtractor #cars #CarManufacturing #FordManufacturing #carfails",

          "text": "They will always be people who maintain their car. This isnt the issue. The issue is how often you need to bring it to the shop to keep it running. It is not acceptable to have widespread transmission breakups at around 20k km. fords are bottom of the table on that metric. And its not just reliability only neither. Quality have gone down the shitter (ford, chevrolet, etc) and the cars keep having issues after issues. \nFord is putting german luxury brand prices on cars. While german brand have the reliability issues ford have, at least they do not have the quality issues (interior finish, etc)",

Then when I was older we had a 1986 Thunderbird (loved it) and a 1989 Mercury Topaz (worst car ever, and the only vehicle I've actually kicked in anger).\n\nSo it's not likely I'll buy a Ford when there are so many options from Toyota/Lexus, Honda/Acura, and Mazda available, but I'd consider it if they made something really special I guess.",
